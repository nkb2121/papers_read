###[Link to Paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2724737)
###Introduction
Now a days, foreign debt consists of more than 30% of the global asset classes, but most investors doesn't have 30% of their portfolio in foreign government bonds. With the US yields at record lows, this paper explores other investment schools of thought. Some interesting points:
*Most bond indexes are market capitalization weighted, which means we invest more in countries that have more debt outstanding. Does this make sense? 
*Global bond indexes are dominated by 5 biggest issuers: US, JP, Germany, France and UK. These 5 countries account for 70% of total debt outstanding, but less than half of global GDP and about 10% global population.

###Value Investing with Bonds
Just like value investing in bonds, we can try to find the high yielding bonds and invest in top 33%. This strategy has shown to exceed in terms of returns and sharpe ratio. One reason could be because the high-yields are associated with non-diversifiable risk factors such as political turmoil or wavering property rights or persistently high inflation.
This strategy is also seen to have volatility similar to the GDP and equal weight porfolios, albeit with a slightly higher drawdown.

###Conclusion
One reason for high yield sorting strategy to work so well is the headline risks of the country. The thought of investing in these countries is scary and hence there is a risk premium associated. 
*Strategy 1: 60% US stocks and 40% US 10 year govt bonds
*Strategy 2: 50% US stocks, 30% US 10 year govt bonds and 20% global high yield bonds
*Strategy 3: 40% US stocks, 20% US 10 year govt bonds, and 40% global high yield bonds
