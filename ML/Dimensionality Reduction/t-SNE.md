# Introduction

## Problem Statement
Given a collection of N-dimensional objects x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>,... x<sub>N</sub>, how can we get the feel for how these objects are arranged in the data space?

## Overview
Build map in which distances between points reflect similarities in the data. Typically PCA can be used to reduce the dimensionality. However the euclidian distance is not a good measure of similarity. 

Earlier methods include, local linear embedding and isomap. This t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding is improved up on from the local linear embedding.
