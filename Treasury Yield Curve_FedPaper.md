#Treasury Yield Curve from Fed

###Abstract
The current paper estimates the treasury yields on a daily basis using a simple smoothing technique

###Introduction
From a practical perspective, the U.S. Treasury market is one of the largest and most liquid markets in the global financial system. In part because of this liquidity, U.S. Treasuries are extensively used to manage interest rate risk, to hedge other interest rate exposures, and to provide a benchmark for the pricing of other assets. **The yield curve that is measured is an off-therun Treasury yield curve based on a large set of outstanding Treasury notes and bonds**
